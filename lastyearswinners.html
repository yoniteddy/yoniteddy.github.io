            <p> Since the competition in July 2015, business has boomed at Philly's Best Cheesesteaks!
                They have excelled tremendously, using the prize money to open up a shop.
                The publicity has resulted in their shops being one of the busiest lunch spots in town.
                And who do they have to thank? FOOD TRUCK WARS!!!
